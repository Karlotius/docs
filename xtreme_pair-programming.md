# Xtreme programming
* The first Extreme Programming project was started March 6, 1996. Extreme Programming is one of several popular Agile Processes.

* Extreme Programming is successful because it stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future this process delivers the software you need as you need it. Extreme Programming empowers your developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements, even late in the life cycle.

 * Extreme Programming emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. Extreme Programming implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.
 
 * Extreme Programming improves a software project in five essential ways; communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage.

## The Rules of Extreme Programming

# Pair Programming
All code to be sent into production is created by two people working together at a single computer. Pair programming increases software quality without impacting time to deliver. It is counter intuitive, but 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two working separately except that it will be much higher in Auality. With increased quality comes big savings later in the project.

 The best way to pair program is to just sit side by side in front of the monitor. Slide the key board and mouse back and forth. Both programmers concentrate on the code being written.

 Pair programming is a social skill that takes time to learn. You are striving for a cooperative way to work that includes give and take from both partners regardless of corporate status. The best pair programmers know when to say "let's try your idea first." Don't expect people to be good at it from the start. It helps if you have someone on your team with experience to show everyone what it should feel like.

 One thing pair programming is not is mentoring. A teacher-student relationship feels very different from two people working together as equals even if one has significantly more experience. It takes time to get used to pair programming so don't worry if it feels awkward at first.

## Pair programming: Driver - Navigator

Pair programming is when two developers work together on the same workstation. One is traditionally called the Driver and the other one is the Navigator. Driver is coding and Navigator is checking the code, offering advice, looking for bugs and thinking ahead.

It can be done remotely as well. The only thing needed is a decent internet connection, headset and any screen sharing software.

**Driver**:
  * Write the code according to the navigator's specification
  * Listen intently to the navigators instructions
  * Ask questions wherever there is a lack of clarity
  * Offer alternative solutions if you disagree with the navigator
  * Where there is disagreement, defer to the navigator. If their idea fails, get to failure quickly and move on
  * Make sure code is clean
  * Own the computer / keyboard
  * Ignore larger issues and focus on the task at hand
  * Trust the navigator - ultimately the navigator has the final say in what is written
  * You are writing the code 

**Navigator**:
  * Dictates the code that is to be written - the 'what'
  * Clearly communicates what code to write
  * Explains 'why' they have chosen the particular solution to this problem
  * Check for syntax / type errors as the Driver drives
  * Be the safety net for the driver
  * Make sure that the driver sticks to the small task at hand
  * Outline and note down high level tasks / issues
  * Ongoing code review
  * Pay attention
  * Wait until the task is complete to bring up design / refactoring issues

**Both**:
  * Actively take part in programming
  * Aim for optimal flow - avoid trying to be 'right'
  * Embrace your role
  * Intervene if your pair is quiet
  * Know when to give up / steal keyboard
  * Communicate, communicate, COMMUNICATE!
  * Sync up frequently to make sure you are on the same page
  * Don't hog the keyboard
  * High-five every time a test passes
  * Follow best practices for TDD
  * Swap roles frequently
